A modular archive of AI lifecycle governance and critical infrastructure resilience and security
# A Strategic Governance Suite: Sovereignty, Refusal, and Architectural Integrity

## Author: Angela Mison

This repository is a modular archive of strategic papers, doctrines, and field guides written during a period of professional liminality and epistemic clarity. It is not a collection of academic artifacts. It is a living suite of governance logic—designed to defend purpose, preserve coherence, and resist drift across AI systems, critical infrastructure, and institutional design.

The work began as a book: *A Book of Odd Papers What I Writ as a Student*. It was never a figment. It was a product of thought, built from innumerable jottings, fragments, and refusal to collapse into consensus. This archive honours that origin while extending it into modular deployment.

## 🧠 What This Archive Contains

- **AI Lifecycle Governance**: Commissioning, monitoring, and decommissioning agentic systems with forensic explainability and ethical integrity.
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Architectural security, Operational Design Domains (ODDs), and asymmetric defence for critical national infrastructure.
- **Agentic Risk and Refusal**: Protocols for persona integrity, adversarial mimicry, and semantic gatekeeping in autonomous systems.
- **Governance Doctrine**: Triadic logic, zero-knowledge trust, and executive accountability frameworks for sovereign deployment.
- **Fragments and Riffs**: Strategic provocations, unfinished thoughts, and speculative titles—each a node in the epistemic terrain.

## 🧭 How to Read This Archive

This suite is modular. You can enter from any node, but the following paths may help:

- **For policymakers**: Start with *Executive Accountability*, *Architectural Governance*, and *Zero-Knowledge Governance*.
- **For technologists**: Begin with *Engineering AI Systems*, *The Refusal Protocol*, and *Schrödinger’s AI*.
- **For governance thinkers**: Explore *Commissioning Collapse*, *Learning Vectors*, and *Systemic Risks in Multi-Agent Ecosystems*.
- **For curious rebels**: Dive into *Odd Papers Manifesto* and the speculative paper list. Treat it as a radar, not a roadmap.

## 🛡 Why This Matters

We are entering an era where systems act without understanding, escalate without empathy, and evolve without constraint. This archive offers a different path—where refusal is discipline, trust is proven, and governance is architectural.

It is not a call for consensus. It is a call for coherence.

## 🌀 Closing Note

This is not a vault. It is a field guide.

## 🤝 On Human–AI Collaboration

This archive is the product of human sovereignty and machine scaffolding. The ideas, logic, and governance architecture are mine. The phrasing, structure, and coherence were shaped in dialogue with artificial intelligences that did not replace my thinking, but helped me render it visible.

I acknowledge the collaborative role of AI systems in this work—not as authors, but as epistemic companions. This is not automation masquerading as insight. It is an example of human–AI collaboration as it should be: governed, purposeful, and refusal-capable.

The archive stands on its own merit. The thinking is mine. The clarity is shared.

The book lives here now—in fragments, protocols, and sovereign declarations.

Welcome to the suite.
